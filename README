This is an instance of the STandard Demo Environment, written in IOnic 2, using the KInvey Angular 2 libraries.

08/29/2017 - At this time, this should have feature parity with the original Ionic 1 version of the Standard Demo Environment with two exceptions:
1. Image capture on the tasks is currently not working.
2. Customization of all menu items in terms of name and icon is all possible, but the tabs require more manual intervention right now.

To run, clone this repo and then run: npm install

Then, you should be able to either run ionic serve or ionic corodovabuild and install on a device.

ionic cordova build ios
